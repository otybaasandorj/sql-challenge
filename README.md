# sql-challenge

At Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company), my first task was to do a research project about the people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. I was provided with six CSV files. To start, I sketched an ERD of the tables in the six CSV files. Creating an ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) before writing your SQL script is helpful for several reasons. Some of the reasons include visually outlines the relationships between entities (tables), making it easier to understand how data will be organized and how entities interact as well as help identify key constraints like primary and foreign keys, ensuring proper referential integrity. Below is my ERD.

Using my ERD, I was able to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files and importing each file into its corresponding SQL table to conduct analysis on the employees. Included in the 'images' folder, you will find screenshots of the results from my SQL queries analyzing the employees at Pewlett Hackard.
